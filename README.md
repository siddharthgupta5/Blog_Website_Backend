## Overview

This is a backend service built with Node.js and Express. It provides API endpoints for [brief description of what your API does, e.g., "managing user data and authentication"].

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (if your project uses MongoDB)

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
```

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root of the project directory. This file should contain environment variables used by the application. Here is a sample .env file:

```bash
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration details.

### Running the Application

To start the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start and listen on the port specified in the `.env` file or default to port `3000`.

### Development Mode

For development, you can use `nodemon` to automatically restart the server on code changes. Start the server in development mode with:

```bash
npm run server
```
